# ESP-Mosaico

An ESP32-S31 interaction kit with a CoreBoard and its supplied BaseBoard.
Use this profile for the assembled kit. It is a separate target from the
[unspecified ESP32-S31 development board](../esp32-s31/README.md).

## Identity and evidence

The [vendor BSP](https://github.com/esp-mosaico/esp-mosaico-bsp/tree/7cbfb390638dcb93522fc3cde094b2d43cf907c2)
supports V1.0 and V1.2 mappings; it maps V1.1 to V1.2.
Read the CoreBoard marking or the BSP hardware-version result before selecting pins.
The operator identified the physical sample as V1.2. Its eFuse revision and
the supplied BaseBoard marking were not independently read.

A [bounded vendor-firmware observation](evidence/vendor-webui.json) confirms
network access to the settings page, a live log connection and module catalog reads.
The operator reported the screen labels `Software 0.4.0` and `GSP 1.5.1`.
These labels do not identify an EmberBSD build or an ESP-Claw source revision.
USB enumeration, recovery and peripheral operation were not established by this check.
The separate [ROM readback check](evidence/rom-readback.json) established Type-C
download access and verified a complete 16 MiB NOR backup against the device.
Its installed partition table differs from the cited Vibe source layout;
see [boot and recovery](boot.md#observed-factory-layout).
The [UART ROM check](evidence/uart-rom.json) also verified bidirectional
identification through H1 with an external USB-UART adapter.
The [RAM-only SPL check](evidence/ram-spl.json) reached its UART receiver and
reported 16 MiB PSRAM density on this sample. It did not test full PSRAM
read/write, U-Boot proper, OpenSBI or an EmberBSD kernel.
There is no accepted EmberBSD runtime result for this Mosaico profile.
